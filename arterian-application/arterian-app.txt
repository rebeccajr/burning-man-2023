Hello!

I think there is an issue with the Arterian application  - the answers listed under the questions in the email do not match up with the questions I was asked on the form, and I believe I was denied volunteership outright due to this discrepancy :( 

Please reconsider my application;  I have included the answers to the questions I was asked on the form below, and also attached a volunteer resume. An online copy of my resume can be found here (https://github.com/rebeccajr/burning-man-2023/blob/master/arterian-application/2023-volunteer-resume-rashkin.pdf)

Why do you want to be part of the ARTerian team? What appeals to you about working with and supporting Burning Man artists?

I want to support the artists that inspire me. I am an engineer and am always in awe of the ingenuity involved in creating playa art.

I find satisfaction in helping others bring their visions to life, whether it be in art, movement. or professional development.

Share with us one of the most rewarding experiences you’ve had working on a team.

I was a lecturer at the University of California, Santa Cruz teaching classes of over 400 students, so I was managing a team of 7 TAs (and another 13 tutors). From the beginning I cultivated a sense of comradery among the staff to ensure effective workflow and general good spirits.

I mentored my TAs on effective pedagogy and it was just super rewarding to see the team so invested in student learning and just generally happy to help in any additional administrative tasks I needed.

Do you prefer to volunteer in the limelight or behind the scenes?
Limelight

If you think it’s worth our knowing, please share your current profession or any interesting/relevant hobbies.

I am a passionate software engineer who practices and teaches handstands 

I have also been working on a side project called ColorClock which is an LED art piece that changes color according to the time of day.

I am an aspiring percussionist and go through phases of creative expression whether it be through painting, crafting, or movement flow.

We are working towards understanding Radical Inclusivity, Diversity and Equity (R.I.D.E.) within the ARTery and how to create a safe and supportive space for all artists, volunteers and participants. We invite you to share with us your own journey around these efforts.

As a woman in a male dominated field, I have experienced challenges associated with my gender and have found myself mentoring many girls and young women dealing with imposter syndrome. When I was a TA in grad school I mentored a transgender student that was having a particularly hard semester, and I noticed a positive shift in her psychological state over the course of our interactions.

- I was told that my inclusive teaching methods when I was a lecturer positively affected the performance of underrepresented students in computer science and engineering
- In grad school I designed and facilitated an electronics art workshop for middle school girls
- I did a career talk and did an electronics demonstration for underrepresented elementary school students

---
How many meetings can you commit to throughout the year?

I promise to do my best to attend all meetings and will only skip them when I absolutely necessary.

How many shifts are you available to commit to for 2023?
